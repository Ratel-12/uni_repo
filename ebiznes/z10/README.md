Completed the task for 3.0. <br />
Used my solution from task 5 with links being changed from localhost to true ones. <br />
The app can be accessed through the link: https://z10-client.salmonbeach-fecfd61a.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io <br />
The connectivity with the backend is clearly working, as the list of products is visible.
